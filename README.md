# CNN_image_classification
Image classification with convolutional neural network (CNN).

This project details the creation and results of a CNN for image classification on red blood cells from patients who are infected or not infected with a specific type of malaria parasite. 

The work herein was done in order to analyze changes in hyperparameters against a base model and the performance metrics were evaluated.

Detailed discussion is included in the jupyter notebook file.
